  "description": "A powerful, platform-first JavaScript library for creating modern user interfaces with declarative HTML. Features universal command chaining, conditional execution, and declarative workflow orchestration via `data-and-then` attributes and `<and-then>` elements. Use the native `command` attribute to build accessible, interactive UIs with sophisticated multi-step workflows, all with zero custom JavaScript. Includes View Transition API support, Interest Invokers (hover cards, tooltips) polyfill, and 40+ built-in expression functions for reactive computations.",
